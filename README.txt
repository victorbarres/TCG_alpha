construction.py
    - VOCAB class was renamed GRAMMAR

    TO_DO:
        - Add test cases

    TO IMPROVE:
        - Introduce symbolic link elements


instance.py
    TO IMPROVE:
        - It seems that semantic distance does not matter in the current version
        (concept match or don't match). Introduce quality of matching.
        See CXN_STRUCT.create()
        - Might improve the parameters that enter in the calculus of suitability.
        - Think about how this integrates with the requirement to implement dynamic C2 computation.
        - See how merge can be generalized (i.e. bring together Merge and Combine.)
        - Think about the issue in both cxn.match(a, b) and cxn_str.combine(a, b) related to the fact that at most 1 result is returned
        when there could potentially be 2 valid results (technically, currently f(a,b) != f(b,a)...)
    
    
scene.py


loader.py
    NOTES:
        - Compared to C++, the scene.txt format has been modified. Keyword "update" added to distinguish between use of "perceive"
        Now use:
        perceive { SCHEMA1, SCHEMA2, SCHEMA3 }
        update { SCHEMA1 = CONCEPT1, SCHEMA2 = CONCEPT2 }
            UPDATE IS NOT THE PROPER TERM!

        - Does not handle image name contain space (C++ code does)
    TO IMPROVE:
        - Migrate data storage format to Json for clarity.


concept.py
    Notes:
    - SEM_NET.ROOT() method was not implemented as it seems to be deprecated
    - SEM_NET.Explore() method was not implemented as it seems to be deprecated
    - CONCEPT.Create() method might need to be revisited...

    TO IMPROVE:
        - Implement SEM_NET as a graph

simulator.py
    TO DO:
        - Check in produce utterance if the number of syllable cannot be more simply computed using synform.num_syllables.
        - Finish DOCSTRINGS!

    TO IMPROVE:
        - Subgraph matching algorithm (invoke_cxn_inst).
        - Concept matching (inb invoke_cxn_inst) is binary and could be improved.
        - Produce utterance:
            - the number of cxn-inst taken into consideration with respect to the thresh_cxn is the total number of cxn_inst in self.cxn_insts...
                might be better to look at each structure independently.
            - similarly for total syllable length: the number of syllables in all the cxn_inst that are in WM are summed...
                might be better to look at the syllable length of each structure...
        - Although the simulator simulates incremental processes, the algorithms DO NOT actually work incrementally. Structures are rebuilt
        each time step.
